BugID:144481, Date:Fri Aug 8 16:20:33 2014, Author:李丹, Git:aa2be289c0f47a252d4bb9452b65c1322788c189
CVE-2014-0195. The dtls1_reassemble_fragment function in d1_both.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h does not properly validate fragment lengths in DTLS ClientHello messages, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) via a long non-initial fragment.

BugID:144451, Date:Fri Aug 8 17:23:21 2014, Author:李丹, Git:1cc6ce4383ce28e6642a8b14c6639c0f617db0ca
CVE-2014-0224. OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h does not properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec messages, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger use of a zero-length master key in certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, and consequently hijack sessions or obtain sensitive information, via a crafted TLS handshake, aka the "CCS Injection" vulnerability.

BugID:109060, Date:Wed Apr 9 15:06:53 2014, Author:余新化, Git:69f4fef9be141f72edea3baaaad9b4fe13946aef
CVE-2014-0160. The (1) TLS and (2) DTLS implementations in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g do not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, as demonstrated by reading private keys, related to d1_both.c and t1_lib.c, aka the Heartbleed bug.

BugID:143857, Date:Wed Jul 30 19:13:22 2014, Author:李丹, Git:472bfbb1088f21a22a3bf20c79581a3461475859
Google bug 13678484. Android Fake ID Vulnerability

BugID:5164850. Date:Fri Aug 8 16:39:27 2014, Author:李丹, Git:72020ea74e54dc93c3e4134c2ffe02dfabb8251c
CVE-2014-3153. The futex_requeue function in kernel/futex.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.5 does not ensure that calls have two different futex addresses, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted FUTEX_REQUEUE command that facilitates unsafe waiter modification.

BugID:5164820, Date:Fri Aug 8 16:27:00 2014, Author:李丹, Git:268c1c020f63521be4d26dad5381ce8802cd23b7
CVE-2014-0196. The n_tty_write function in drivers/tty/n_tty.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.3 does not properly manage tty driver access in the "LECHO & !OPOST" case, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) or gain privileges by triggering a race condition involving read and write operations with long strings.

BugID:5164834, Date:Fri Aug 8 17:04:18 2014, Author:李丹, Git:4f4c12f4017a8135fbefeaf9a5138554db3e1b33
CVE-2013-0871. Race condition in the ptrace functionality in the Linux kernel before 3.7.5 allows local users to gain privileges via a PTRACE_SETREGS ptrace system call in a crafted application, as demonstrated by ptrace_death.

BugID:109630, Date:Thu Apr 10 19:09:25 2014, Author:余新化, Git:effb3ecbd0a7fdf96759f694c89608d5802f48f3
CVE-2014-0069. The cifs_iovec_write function in fs/cifs/file.c in the Linux kernel through 3.13.5 does not properly handle uncached write operations that copy fewer than the requested number of bytes, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash), or possibly gain privileges via a writev system call with a crafted pointer.

BugID:109355, Date:Thu Apr 10 11:13:02 2014, Author:余新化, Git:3c32275fcacc8428e4ebd91b6cdc80fd879e2067
CVE-2014-1874. The security_context_to_sid_core function in security/selinux/ss/services.c in the Linux kernel before 3.13.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) by leveraging the CAP_MAC_ADMIN capability to set a zero-length security context.

BugID:109213, Date:Wed Apr 9 17:55:32 2014, Author:余新化, Git:5a65f54d08d36a7fcc60a8091fc9a893e862296d
CVE-2014-2523. net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_dccp.c in the Linux kernel through 3.13.6 uses a DCCP header pointer incorrectly, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a DCCP packet that triggers a call to the (1) dccp_new, (2) dccp_packet, or (3) dccp_error function.
